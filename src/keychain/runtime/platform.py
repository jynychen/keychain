"""Runtime environment detection.

Keychain manages POSIX agents (``ssh-agent``, ``gpg-agent``) and assumes a
POSIX-shaped userland (``ps``, ``kill``, UNIX-domain sockets, shell-style
environment files). Rather than scattering ``sys.platform`` checks across
process listing, signal installation and pidfile handling, we resolve the
host environment **once** at startup and let the rest of the codebase ask
a single :class:`Platform` for what it needs (or refuse to run).

The detected platform is cached for the life of the process; tests that
need to override it can call :func:`reset` and then :func:`detect` with a
``platform_override`` argument.
